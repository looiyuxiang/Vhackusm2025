## 🛠 Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- ✅ **Python** (version 3.x) - [Download Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- ✅ **VS Code** (Visual Studio Code) - [Download Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 🚀 Setting Up the Environment in VS Code

### 🔹 1️⃣ Create a Project Folder  
📂 Open **VS Code**, create a **new folder**, and open it (**File > Open Folder...**).

### 🔹 2️⃣ Create a Python File  
📜 Inside the folder, create a new file named **`app.py`**.

### 🔹 3️⃣ Install Python and Set Up a Virtual Environment  
1. Ensure **Python** is installed ([Download Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).  
2. Open the terminal:
   - **Windows**: `Ctrl + ~`  
   - **macOS**: `Cmd + ~`  
3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:  

   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows (CMD/Powershell)**:  
     ```sh
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:  
     ```sh
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Now, your environment is ready! 🎉 Install dependencies using `pip`.

### 🔹 4️⃣ Copy `app.py` from the Repository  
📂 Copy the **`app.py`** file from the cloned repository into your project folder.

### 🔹 5️⃣ Install Dependencies  
📌 Navigate to your project folder in the terminal and run:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

💡 If `requirements.txt` is missing, generate it using:
   ```sh
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

### 🔹 6️⃣ Run the Project  
▶ Start the application by running:

   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

### 🔹 7️⃣ Open the HTTP Link  
🌐 After executing the command, an HTTP link (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`) will appear in the terminal.
🔗 **Ctrl + Click** on the link to open the project in your browser.
